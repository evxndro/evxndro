What's up, welcome to my github profile ğŸ¤ªğŸ¤™

My name is Evandro, and extremely passionate about the world of technology. I always seek to develop skills to become a programmer/developer. I'm a student of Information Systems in search of greater specialization, in addition to interactions with programming languages. I have a basic understanding of Python and learning Java as well. ğŸš€ğŸ§ ğŸ’»
